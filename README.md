# States-Guesser

Welcome to my States Guesser game v1!
This is a super simple game I made in Python with the use of Tkinter module. 
Currently, to play the game just download the files and run it in your fav code editor!
The game allows you to enter states and has a counter that keeps track of all your correct guesses.
It also creates a study file of the states you did not get once you quit the game.
to quit, just tyoe 'Quit' in the guess field.

In future updates I would like to add:
  1) Filling up the state with a color once you guess it, to help you visually see the ones you have already done.
  2) Add a profile center to login and keep track of your highscores.
  3) add a timer option for a speed mode.
